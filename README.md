# maptify

This website uses leaflet API to fetch the map.
In this, we mark the position of a user on the map.
The user has 2 workouts:
1) Running
2) Cycling
All the information is displayed in the map with the marker pointed at the exact location.
This website uses local storage to keep track of the positions even after the website is loaded.
